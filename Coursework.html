					<p>
						This year I'm enrolled in AP Computer Science Principle, a class 
						that focuses on coding as well as many other aspects of computers.
						From learning python to creating turtles, I have learned so much 
						this year. Here, I have listed most of what I've done this year. 
						Enjoy!

					<h3>1) Scratch Project</h3>
					<p>
						Scratch was one of the first projects our class did. With Scratch, we
						were able to learn the basics of programming. Click on the scratch icon
						to see the game I was able to create!

					<h3>2) Python Story</h3>
					<p>
						We were then introduced to python. To start off we simply created 
						a yes or no story. This was extremely fun because we were able to
						create different scenarios which resulted in different endings.
						Click on the repl.it icon to view my story.

					<h3> 3)Turtle Intro Project</h3>
						Turtle was a cool project because we used python in order
						to draw different and unique shapes. Additionally, we could 
						add color to make it stand out even more. Click on the turtle 
						icon to download my work!
