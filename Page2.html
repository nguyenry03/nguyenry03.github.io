					<p>
						There are 30 teams in the NBA. 15 in the Western Conference and 15 in the Easter Conference. Each week the 30 teams are ranked based
						on their weekly record and how they've played. These power rankings are a good indication of what teams are on top of the NBA. Additionally, these rankings change weekly 
						as certain teams improve or drop. Check back here weekly in order to get an idea of what team 
						is controlling the league.

					<h3>1) Houston Rockets</h3>
					<p>
						Lately, the Rockets seem unstoppable. The Rockets are being led by their
						strong backcourt of James Harden and Chris Paul. NBA lovers can finally 
						see the full extent of the Rockets' dominance since Chris Paul is finally
						able to play after sufferin an injury earlier this season. Since his return
						the Rockets truly look like they can challenge the Warriors. For more information,
						click on the Rockets' logo.

					<a href = "http://www.nba.com/warriors/"><img src = "warriors.jpg" align = "right" height = "150" width = "100"></a>
					<h3>2) Golden State Warriors</h3>
					<p>
						The Warriors have gotten their MVP back. After returning from injury
						Stephen Curry truly looks unstoppable. Breaking ankles and shooting game 
						winners left and right. After defeating the league's top teams 
						including the Clevelamnd Cavaliers and the Houston Rockets, the Warriors look
						like they are a lock for the NBA FInals. For more information, click on
						the Warrior's logo.

					<a href = "http://www.nba.com/celtics/gtl"><img src = "celtics.jpg" align = "right" height = "150" width = "100"></a>
					<h3>3) Boston Celtics</h3>
					<p>
						The Celtics are on a roll and it helps that their next couple of games are
						all against teams with records below .500. Kyrie Riving is mesmerizing as always,
						but what's keeping this team on top of the pack is their defensive capabilities 
						behind players like Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart. For more information, click
						on the Celtic's logo.

					<a href = "http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/"><img src = "c.jpg" align = "right" height = "150" width = "100"></a>
					<h3>4) Cleveland Cavaliers</h3>
					<p>
						The Cav's win streak has come to an end over the weekend, but that does not mean
						they're dropping to the bottom of the rankings. In fact, LeBron James has never
						looked better and that is a scary sight for the rest of the league. The King is
						coming for his trophy. For more information, click on the Cavaliers' logo.

					<a href = "http://www.nba.com/raptors/?splash=off?splash=off"><img src = "raps.jpg" height = "150" width = "100" align= "right"></a>
					<h3>5) Toronto Raptors </h3>	
					<p>
						Don't look now but the Toronto Raptors are second in the Eastern Conference.
						Yes, even above the 2016-2017 Eastern Conference Champions Cleveland Cavaliers.
						The Raptors are led by Demar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry who can play on both sides 
						of the ball. For more information, click on the Raptors' logo.
